# Wolfden Design

**Status:** draft v0.1 (2026-10-10). Everything here is open to revision until
there's code that depends on it. Decisions already made are recorded in
[`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). This doc explains them and fills in the shape.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

### Goals

1. **Keep a series' lore consistent across many books.** Characters,
   settings, timelines, plot threads, and invented things of any kind.
2. **Know when each fact becomes true.** Every fact can carry the story
   position where it enters canon, so "what's true as of Book 2, chapter 14?"
   has an answer.
3. **Plain files, no lock-in.** Notes are markdown files in a git repo you
   own. You can read them, edit them in any editor, and keep them forever.
4. **AI-native.** AI assistants are first-class users, connected through an
   MCP server and working from structured data instead of pasted documents.
5. **Works with notes edited outside the app.** You can edit the files in
   VS Code, an AI agent can rewrite a section, and Wolfden picks up the change.

### Non-goals (for now)

- **Not a manuscript editor.** Wolfden holds the story bible, not the prose.
  (Scrivener, Word, and plain markdown already do prose well.)
- **No publishing or formatting.**
- **No real-time collaboration in v0.** Multi-user hosting is a later phase
  (§10). The v0 design must not *rule it out*, but doesn't build for it.

## 2. Core concepts

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Den** | A Wolfden workspace: one git repository of notes. It can hold one or many universes. To give a universe its own private remote, give it its own den. |
| **Author Identity** | Who a work is by: a real name, a pen name, or a collaboration. Metadata in v0, and the anchor for ownership in multi-user mode later. |
| **Universe** | A shared setting for one or more related works. |
| **Series** | An *ordered* sequence of books within a universe. |
| **Book** | A single work, either in a series or standalone in a universe. It has an ordered list of chapters. Scenes within chapters come later. |
| **Entity** | A single note about one thing: a character, a planet, a faction, a plot thread. Every entity has a **type**. |
| **Type** | A schema for entities: frontmatter fields, standard sections, and a template. |
| **Pack** | A bundle of types for a genre or purpose (core, space opera, epic fantasy, ...). |
| **Story position** | A point in the story: a book key plus a chapter key, written `ember:14`. v0 positions are chapter-level. `ember:14.2` (scene 2 of chapter 14) is reserved for later. **Decided (#2):** a bare `ember` means the start of that book. |

### Scope and inheritance

Every entity lives at exactly one **scope**: Universe, Series, or Book.
Where an entity is filed decides where it enters canon when it has no
`from`, which entities a series or book filter keeps, and which match wins
when links tie. It doesn't decide whether a canon view shows the entity: a
canon view at a position covers every scope of the universe, in story
order, so a Book 4 view shows a side character filed under Book 1
([`format.md`](format.md) F-VIEW-1). A character who appears across a whole
series lives at Series (or Universe) scope. A one-book side character lives
at Book scope.

Entities can **reference across scopes** in any direction. Book 3 can link to
a character introduced in a standalone book in the same universe. A reference
to a *later* book is allowed. A den that turns on spoiler checks gets it
flagged (§7), since it's usually a spoiler or a mistake.

### Entities don't span universes

A universe is the boundary for story entities, links, and story positions.
Positions are ordered only among one universe's books, so an entity shared
between universes would have no clear "canon as of" answer.

- **Crossovers mean it's one universe.** If two series share characters and
  their history matters (a Cosmere-style shared cosmology), model them as two
  Series in one Universe.
- **Incarnations are copies.** The same idea recast per setting (an
  archetype, a recurring narrator voice) is a separate entity in each
  universe. A `see_also` field can point between the copies.
- **Links resolve within the universe.** A link that would match only an
  entity in another universe is flagged, not resolved.

**Planned (#45): Author and den notes.** Timeless material that isn't story
canon, such as voice and style rules or real-world research, will be able to
live above Universe: at Author Identity scope (`authors/<slug>/notes/`) or
den scope (`notes/`). Universes will inherit them, and they can't carry story
positions. Until then, keep such notes at Universe scope. Moving one up later
is a file move, since ids don't depend on paths.

## 3. On-disk format

The normative rules for §3 and §5 are in [`format.md`](format.md). This
section explains the shape. Where the two differ, `format.md` wins.

### Den layout

```text
my-den/
  den.yaml                      # den settings, author identities, enabled packs
  packs/                        # den-local custom types (optional)
  # notes/ and authors/ are reserved for Author and den notes (§2, #45)
  # anything else at the root (a README, a LICENSE) is ignored
  universes/
    starfall/
      universe.md               # frontmatter + overview prose
      entities/                 # universe-scope entities, grouped by type
        species/
          velari.md
        locations/
          kessan-reach.md
      series/
        long-dark/
          series.md             # frontmatter lists book order
          entities/
            characters/
              mara-voss.md
          books/
            ember/
              book.md           # frontmatter lists chapters
              entities/
              outline.md        # outline rows (see §5)
      books/                    # standalone books in this universe
        a-quiet-moon/
          book.md
```

Folder names are slugs for humans. **Identity comes from the `id` in
frontmatter, not from the path** (once a file has one; tools add it), so files
can be renamed or moved between scopes without breaking links. The app rewrites
slug links and positions when it renames something. After a rename by hand,
links by id, name, or alias still work (format.md F-RT-5).

### An entity file

```markdown
---
id: 01JA7Q8M4XK3V9R2D5W8HN6TQB   # ULID, assigned on creation, never changes
type: character
name: Mara Voss
aliases: [Voss, "the Commander"]
status: canon                    # see format.md §9.3 for all six
fields:
  species: "[[velari]]"
  rank:
    - { value: Lieutenant, from: "ember:1" }
    - { value: Commander,  from: "ember:22" }
  born: "2291"
---

# Mara Voss

## Overview
Executive officer of the *Tessaly*...

## Appearance
Silver-streaked hair, a burn scar along her left forearm.

## Shoulder injury
<!-- wolfden: from=ember:19 -->
Takes a flechette round at Kessan Reach; the arm never fully recovers.

## Custom: Things she never says aloud
...
```

Key points:

- **Fields can change over time.** A plain value means it's always true. A list
  of `{value, from, until?}` entries means it's true at story positions.
  **Decided (#66):** a single entry with a `from` is allowed on any field,
  even one that isn't temporal (except `row`). It means "known from here":
  a death or a hidden identity stays out of canon views from before the
  reader learns it.
- **Sections can carry positions too.** A `<!-- wolfden: from=... -->`
  comment on the line under a heading (one blank line allowed; with an
  optional `until=`)
  marks the whole section as entering canon at that point. GitHub,
  Obsidian, and VS Code hide HTML comments, so headings render cleanly and
  heading links keep working. Other HTML comments are left alone. This is a
  structured version of "Book 3, chapter 23 additions" sections in a
  hand-kept character file. **Decided (#71):** a later section with the
  same standard heading (a new `## Appearance` for a new era) takes over
  from the earlier one at its `from`, the way a new field entry does, so
  the earlier one needs no `until`. Custom sections don't hand over, so
  cumulative ones can repeat. **Decided (#68):** a thread's `## Payoff`
  enters canon at the thread's `paid_off` unless it says otherwise.
- **Links** are wiki-style: `[[mara-voss]]`, `[[Mara Voss]]`, or an alias.
  They resolve by slug, name, or alias to an `id` within the same universe
  (§2), and the index stores the id (or the path, for a file that has
  no id yet). Ambiguous links are flagged.
- **Status** keeps undecided material out of canon views without moving it
  elsewhere. `idea` entities are what a hand-kept "idea bank" holds.
- **Entities enter canon at a position.** An optional top-level `from`
  says where the reader first meets the entity. It defaults to the start of
  the entity's book, series, or the story, by scope, and canon-as-of views
  leave the entity out before it.
- **Sections and field values have a status too.** The section comment
  takes `status=` (`<!-- wolfden: status=candidate from=ember:19 -->`), and
  a field entry takes `status:`. Entities and facts share one vocabulary:
  `idea`, `undecided` (a question with options banked), `candidate` (one
  option), `draft`, `canon`, and `retconned`. An entity or outline row
  without a status is `draft`. Canon views leave out
  non-canon sections and values, and a section can't be more canon than its
  entity.
- **Pinned facts are hard canon.** `pin=true` on a section or `pin: true`
  on a field entry marks the facts most important to check before drafting.
  A **pinned canon** view lists them as of a position, for the whole
  universe or filtered to a series or book.
- Unknown frontmatter keys and sections are kept intact. The app must never
  discard what a human or an agent wrote.

## 4. Types and packs

The normative rules for packs, types, field types, and templates are in
[`types.md`](types.md), and the core pack's files are in
[`packs/core/`](../packs/core/).

A pack is a folder with a `pack.yaml` manifest, a YAML file per type in
`types/`, and markdown templates in `templates/`. A type is a YAML file
named by its key:

```yaml
# packs/core/types/character.yaml, shortened
name: Character
plural: characters                    # its folder under entities/
fields:
  role:     { type: text, temporal: true }
  born:     date                      # in-world date: free text plus a sort key
  species:  text                      # plain text, or a link to a species entity
  factions: { type: ref, to: faction, list: true, temporal: true }
sections:                             # standard sections, in section order
  - Overview
  - Appearance
  - Want
template: character.md
```

Field types: `string`, `text`, `number`, `bool`, `date`, `enum`, `ref` (a
link, optionally to given types), and `position`, each optionally a `list`.
`temporal: true` marks values that change over time, and `required` and
`default` are available. Every type also has the `row` and `placeholder`
fields.

**Planned packs:**

- **core** (always on): character, location, faction, item, event, thread
  (a plot thread with planted and paid-off positions), idea, note
  (free-form).
- **space-opera**: star-system, planet, settlement, species, polity,
  ship-class, ship, technology.
- **epic-fantasy**: realm, magic-system, creature, deity, artifact, order.

Dens can define their own types in `packs/`, or extend any enabled type
by adding fields, sections, or a template (`extensions/`). Extensions
add; they don't change what another pack defines.

**Decided (#6): the den wins.** When a den-local definition clashes with
a built-in one (a pack key, a type, a `plural`, an extension's field or
section, or a chapter field), the den-local one is used and the built-in
one is ignored, with a warning that names the clash. A den-local pack
named like a built-in pack shadows it. So an upgrade never overrides a
den's own definitions. Built-in packs change only by adding: changing an
existing built-in field's type, renaming a section, or adding or changing
a default is a breaking change, while template prompts and headings may
change in any release, since they only affect new entities. A writer who
relies on a custom field should define it in a den-local pack (types.md
§2.4). Versioning policy is #56. Clashes between two den-local packs are
settled by pack order (see types.md F-PACK-11).

**Decided (#6): your writing is yours.** Wolfden's licenses place no
conditions on the notes, manuscripts, or other content writers create with
it. The built-in packs in `packs/` are licensed MIT-0 (no attribution
required), so headings and prompts copied from a template carry no
conditions either.

## 5. Structure and time

The normative rules for books, chapters, positions, and outlines are in
[`format.md`](format.md) §6, §8, and §11.

### Books and chapters

`book.md` frontmatter holds the ordered chapter list. Each chapter has a
stable key, a number, an optional title, and optional fields from packs:
core defines POV, narration (first person, third limited, and so on),
tense, and an in-world date. A universe, series, or book can set
`chapter_defaults` once (say, third person past tense for a whole series),
and a chapter's own fields override them. Story positions refer to chapter
keys, so renumbering chapters doesn't break positions. Book and chapter keys
can't contain `:` or `.`, which the position syntax uses as separators.

### Outline rows

An outline is a list of **rows** (beats) with stable IDs that keep counting
across books in a series. Book 1 might end at row 36, so Book 2 starts at row
37. That way a reference like "row 69a" is never ambiguous. Rows can be
split (`69a`, `69b`) without renumbering anything. **Decided (#2):** an
outline is a set of GFM tables with `row` and `beat` columns, plus
`chapter`, `pov`, `status`, and any custom columns. Rows stay one line, and
details live in an entity linked from the row.

Positions stay `book:chapter`: rows aren't positions in v0. An event can
point at rows with a plain `row:` field, and `ember:r75` is reserved for
row positions later, the same way `ember:14.2` is reserved for scenes.

### Timeline

Timeline entries are `event` entities with two independent axes:

- **In-world time:** when it happens in the story world. Free text plus a
  sortable key in v0 (the `when` field, a `date`, types.md). A date such
  as `2291-05-14 06:40`, with an optional time of day, sorts by itself.
  Custom calendars (fantasy months, stardates) come later (#37).
- **Story position:** where the reader learns of it. Flashbacks and reveals
  make these differ, and the difference is often the interesting part.

### Freezing a finished book

When a book is done, **freezing** it adds a git tag (`book/ember/final`) and
marks it `status: final`. After that, edits to that book's scope are refused
unless explicitly unfrozen. This replaces hand-made `_FINAL` copies.

## 6. History and versioning

Git is the history. Wolfden doesn't keep its own audit trail.

- **Per-entity history** is `git log` on the entity's file, with diffs, shown
  in the UI and exposed through MCP.
- **Saving vs. committing:** edits are written to the working tree straight
  away. **Checkpoints** are commits with a message, made by the user ("end of
  Ch 14 session") or automatically after a configurable idle period. Commits
  made by AI agents through MCP record the agent as `Co-Authored-By`.
- **Remotes:** optional. Wolfden can push and pull a configured remote but
  never requires one.
- **The index is never the only copy of anything.** Deleting it loses
  nothing (§7).

## 7. Index, queries, and continuity checks

A SQLite database (`.wolfden/index.db`, gitignored inside the den) built
from the files:

- Tables for entities, field values (with from/until positions), sections
  (with positions), links, outline rows, and positions, plus FTS5 for
  full-text search.
- **Rebuilt** fully on demand and incrementally through a file watcher, so
  edits made outside the app show up within moments.
- **Self-healing.** A full rebuild writes a new file and swaps it in, so a
  crash never leaves a half-built index. An index that's missing,
  unreadable (say, after a sync conflict), or from another schema version
  is rebuilt, not repaired. Wolfden puts a `.gitignore` inside `.wolfden/`
  so git skips the folder without changes to the den's own `.gitignore`.
- **Folder links are skipped** (#102; v0 behaviour, not a recorded
  decision). Every walk of a den (the loader, the files hash, the watcher,
  and `init`'s search for dens below) skips symbolic links and junctions
  to folders, as git does, so links can't loop and each note has one
  path. `check` warns about each link where the den reads files
  (format.md F-LAY-2), so linked notes aren't dropped silently.
  Cloud-sync placeholders (OneDrive, Dropbox) aren't links and are read
  as usual.
- **Watched** (#14; v0 behaviour, not a recorded decision). The file
  watcher collects a burst of saves (an editor's temporary file and
  rename, a git checkout) into one batch, and ignores hidden paths such as
  `.wolfden/` and `.git/` (format.md F-LAY-2). For a batch of changed
  entity files and outlines it reads only those files again, then redoes
  the steps that span files: duplicate ids and resolving every link. A
  change to `den.yaml`, a pack, or a universe, series, or book file, a
  folder added, moved, or deleted where it can change the structure, lost
  events, or an index someone else rebuilt meanwhile gets a full rebuild
  instead. Files the index doesn't read, such as a `README.md` at the den
  root, change nothing, not even the files hash (#103). Each
  batch is written in one transaction, so a query sees the index before
  the batch or after it. After it commits, the watcher checks that the
  index file it wrote is still the one in place, since on Linux another
  process's rebuild can replace it mid-batch (#106), and rebuilds if it
  isn't. A window remains, as known v0 behaviour: a rebuild in another
  process that read the files before a save, but swaps its index in
  after the watcher's check, leaves an index without that save. It
  heals itself: the watcher's next batch finds the index isn't the one it
  wrote and rebuilds, and a `query` meanwhile sees that the files hash
  differs and rebuilds too. Closing the window would need a lock shared
  across processes for the whole rebuild. The index always ends up as a full rebuild of the
  same files would make it, apart from the ids of rows that came from
  single files, which queries never order by.

**Canon as of** is the main query. Given a position, it returns each
entity's field values and sections in effect at that point, leaving out
`idea` and `retconned` material. Point-in-story reading, spoiler-safe
reference and continuity checks all build on it.

**`wolfden check`** (continuity lint), v0 rules:

- Broken or ambiguous links, including a link that matches only an entity
  in another universe.
- Missing required fields or sections.
- Positions that refer to books or chapters that don't exist.
- Overlapping temporal values for the same field.
- Duplicate IDs (for example, from copying files by hand).
- **Spoiler checks**, off by default: a link to an entity the reader
  hasn't met yet at the link's position, such as a reference from an
  earlier book to an entity that first appears in a later one.

**Decided (#68): spoiler checks are opt-in.** The positions on facts record
where the reader learns each one, so a writer can pace the reveals. Not
every writer tracks that, so the check that helps them is off unless
`den.yaml` sets `spoiler_checks: true` (format.md F-DEN-7). It sees links,
not prose, so summary prose that runs ahead of the story is the writer's
to place (format.md §9.5).

Later rules: a character appearing after their death, travel times that
don't fit the timeline, and open threads at a frozen book's end.

### The command line (v0)

**v0 behaviour, not a recorded decision** (#17). The CLI has five
commands, and `wolfden <command> --help` describes each one:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `wolfden init [<folder>] [--name <name>] [--universe <key>]` | Creates a den: a `den.yaml`, and with `--universe` a first universe with an id. It never overwrites anything, and refuses a folder inside another den or one that holds a den up to four folder levels below it (format.md F-LAY-1; the downward search skips hidden folders and folder links, and stops after 2,000 folders). The new den passes `check` with no warnings. |
| `wolfden check [<den>] [--fix]` | The continuity lint above. It reads the files directly, not the index. Without `--fix` it never writes. `--fix` first gives every container and entity file that loads without an `id` a new one (format.md F-ID-2, F-ID-6), skipping files in a final book (F-BOOK-1), and then checks the den as it is after the fix. |
| `wolfden index [<den>] [--watch]` | Rebuilds `.wolfden/index.db` from the files and says what it holds. `--watch` then keeps it up to date as files change (#14), printing one line for each batch of changes it applies (with `--json`, one JSON object per line), until Ctrl+C. Only one watcher runs per den; a second exits 2. |
| `wolfden query [<universe>] [--at <position>]` | Canon as of a position (format.md F-VIEW-1), from the index. The universe can be left out when the den has only one. `--series` or `--book` narrows the view, `--type` (any type an enabled pack defines) and `--entity` (matched as a link is, F-LINK-6) pick entities out of it, `--pinned` gives pinned canon (F-VIEW-2), and `--brief` lists one line per entity. |
| `wolfden new-id [<count>]` | Prints new ids for files made by hand (format.md F-ID-5). |

They share one surface:

- **Which den.** `--den <folder>` names it (`check` and `index` also take
  it as a plain argument). Otherwise it's the current folder, or the
  nearest folder above it that holds a `den.yaml`, as git finds its
  repository.
- **Output.** Text by default. `check` prints one line per diagnostic,
  `path:line: severity rule: message`, with paths relative to the den
  root, then a summary. `query` prints each entity as a heading, its
  fields as a list, then its lead and sections, each marked with any
  `from`, `until`, `pinned`, or `draft`. `--json` prints one JSON
  document instead, with a `version` for its shape. Within a `version`,
  fields may be added, but renaming or removing a field, or changing what
  one means, needs a new `version`. Results go to standard output, and
  mistakes and failures to standard error.
- **Exit codes.** 0 when the command did its job; for `check`, when the
  den has no errors (warnings alone pass, format.md F-GEN-1); for `index
  --watch`, when it's stopped with Ctrl+C. 1 only from
  `check`, when the den has at least one error. 2 when the command
  couldn't do its job: a wrong command line, no den, a `den.yaml` that
  doesn't load, a universe, position, filter, type, or entity that doesn't
  exist (for `query`, a den with no universes yet, or with several and
  none named), or an unexpected failure. A `query` whose view is empty,
  such as one for a character the reader hasn't met yet, exits 0.
- **A fresh index.** `query` reads the index, but first compares a hash
  of the files the index reads (`den.yaml`, packs, container files,
  entity files, and outlines) with the one recorded when the index was
  built, and rebuilds it if they differ, so an answer never
  lags behind an edit. `index --watch` keeps both the index and that hash
  up to date as files change, so while it runs a query rarely needs to
  rebuild: when the hash differs and a watcher is running, `query` first
  waits up to about a second for it to catch up (#108). The long-running `serve` and `mcp` will host the same watcher.
  `--watch` keeps going when `den.yaml` stops loading, so the writer can
  fix it, and reports a batch that fails on standard error, then rebuilds.

## 8. AI integration (MCP)

Wolfden ships an MCP server, using the official C# MCP SDK, over the same core
library the API uses. Draft tool surface:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `search` | Full-text and field search across a den or scope |
| `get_entity` | One entity, optionally `as_of` a position |
| `list_entities` | By type, scope, or status |
| `canon_as_of` | A summary of canon at a position, with an optional series or book filter |
| `get_history` | Commit history and diffs for an entity |
| `create_entity` | From a type template |
| `update_fields` / `append_section` | Structured edits that keep everything else intact |
| `add_idea` | Record undecided material with `status: idea` |
| `check` | Run continuity checks and return findings |
| `checkpoint` | Commit with a message |

Writes go through the same validation as the UI. An agent can't save a file
the parser would reject.

`canon_as_of` and `get_entity` serve **pinned canon** first
([`format.md`](format.md) §9.4), so an agent sees the hard facts before
the rest.

## 9. Architecture

```text
src/
  Wolfden.Core/     # model, markdown and frontmatter parsing, positions, canon-as-of logic
  Wolfden.Index/    # EF Core + SQLite index, file watcher, FTS
  Wolfden.Git/      # history, checkpoints, tags (LibGit2Sharp or git CLI)
  Wolfden.Api/      # ASP.NET Core minimal API (.NET 10)
  Wolfden.Mcp/      # MCP server
  Wolfden.Cli/      # `wolfden init | check | index | query | new-id | serve | mcp`
web/                # React + TypeScript + Vite + TanStack Query
samples/            # sample dens (CC-BY-4.0)
docs/
```

- **v0 runs locally as one process.** `wolfden serve` hosts the API and the
  built web UI on localhost and opens a browser. `wolfden mcp` runs the MCP
  server over stdio for AI clients.
- **Parsing round-trips.** Read-modify-write keeps formatting, ordering, and
  unknown content. This gets heavy test coverage, since it decides whether
  people trust the tool with their notes.
- **Docker comes with hosting (§10).** It isn't needed for local use.

## 10. Phases

| Phase | Delivers |
|---|---|
| **M0: Format** | This doc settled; the format spec written; the Dracula sample written *by hand* in the format. The format can be used with any editor and an AI assistant before any code exists. |
| **M1: Core + CLI** | Parse, index, `wolfden check`, and canon-as-of queries from the command line. Round-trip test suite over the samples. |
| **M2: MCP** | The MCP server. Ships early because it's useful on its own: an AI assistant can work with a den before any UI exists. |
| **M3: Web UI (read)** | Browse the hierarchy, entity pages, search, a story-position "as of" slider, history and diffs. |
| **M4: Web UI (edit)** | Edit fields and sections, create from templates, checkpoints, freeze and unfreeze. |
| **M5: Packs + full sample** | Space opera and fantasy packs, plus the invented multi-book sample with history. |

## 11. Sample datasets

These live under `samples/` and are licensed CC-BY-4.0. They're used for docs,
demos, and test fixtures.

- **`dracula`** (small): Bram Stoker's *Dracula* (1897, public domain). It's
  told in dated journals and letters by several narrators, which makes it a
  well-known, checkable test of timelines, POV, and story position vs.
  in-world time. Readers can verify its accuracy for themselves.
- **Invented series** (full; name TBD): an original two-book series, Book 1
  frozen and Book 2 in progress. It shows ideas, open threads, a retcon,
  outline rows continuing across books, and packs. It ships with **history**:
  a script replays a series of snapshots into a fresh git repo, so the
  versioning features have something real to show.
- **Possible later sample:** the Oz series, whose author contradicted
  himself often across 14 books. It would be a good stress test for
  continuity checks.

## 12. Open questions

1. ~~**Positions on sections:** is `{from="..."}` on headings the right
   syntax, or would HTML comments render more cleanly in other markdown
   tools?~~ **Decided (#3):** an HTML comment on the line under the heading,
   `<!-- wolfden: from=ember:19 until=ember:30 -->`. Attribute braces show up
   as literal text in GitHub, Obsidian, and VS Code and break heading links.
2. ~~**Positions finer than a chapter:** are scenes needed in v0?~~
   **Decided (#4):** no. v0 positions are chapter-level. The syntax
   `ember:14.2` is reserved for scenes, and v0 rejects it with a clear
   "scenes not supported yet" error instead of misreading it.
3. ~~**Entities that span universes** (the same author's recurring
   narrator, say): are they needed, or are copies across universes fine?~~
   **Decided (#5):** not in v0. Crossovers mean one universe, incarnations
   are copies, and links resolve within a universe (§2). Timeless Author and
   den notes are planned (#45), and their folder names are reserved now.
4. **Auto-checkpoint defaults:** an idle-time commit, or manual only by
   default?
5. **Desktop packaging:** is a localhost web app enough, or wrap it later
   (Tauri, Electron, .NET MAUI)?
6. **Name for the invented sample universe.**
7. ~~**Undecided and must-check material inside an entity:** how to mark a
   section or field value as an option still being weighed, or as a fact
   that must not be broken?~~ **Decided (#2):** sections and field entries
   carry their own `status`, from one vocabulary shared with entities that
   now includes `undecided` and `candidate`, capped by the entity's status.
   `pin` marks hard canon, served first as **pinned canon**. Positions stay
   `book:chapter`, and `ember:r75` is reserved for outline-row positions,
   which v0 rejects. A bare `ember` means the start of
   the book. A section headed like a change log or session notes
   (built-in patterns plus any in `den.yaml`), or one marked `canon=false`, is
   bookkeeping and stays out of canon views. There's no separate "locked"
   state in v0: writers use `status: canon` plus `pin`. If agents need write
   protection, it belongs to the MCP write tools (M2), not the format.
